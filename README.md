> Welcome to Django for Professionals, a guide to building professional websites with the Django
web framework

There is a massive gulf between building simple “toy apps” that can be created
and deployed quickly and what it takes to build a “production-ready” web application suitable for deployment to thousands or even millions of users. This book will show you to how to bridge that gap.

Since the beanstalk platform we’re targeting is Python3.8, so we have the following prerequisites:

*   Python 3.8
*   Docker
*	[Add Gitignore for Django](https://djangowaves.com/tips-tricks/gitignore-for-a-django-project/) (If you are using Git for version control, you need a Gitignore file to ignore all files that don’t matter and shouldn’t be in your git repository)


Step 1. Docker Hello, World
------------------------------------------------

Docker ships with its own “Hello, World” image that is a helpful first step to run. On the command line type docker run hello-world. This will download an official Docker image and then run it within a container. We’ll discuss both images and containers in a moment.:

	$ docker run hello-world
    
Step 2. After install Docker Restart your machine
------------------------------------------------
	$ sudo reboot
    
    
Step 3. Follow the steps on the book
------------------------------------------------
